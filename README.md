Memory Matcher

User is presented with a game board of nondescript vinyl records outside of their storage sleeves, obscuring their respective album jackets. Each album jacket image is shared by only one other record. User will select one record at a time, revealing it's jacket's image while attempting to memorize said image and it's position on the board. User's goal is to select each matching pair of records in succession, until all record jackets have been revealed, thus completing play.

Technoligies used: Javascript, HTML, CSS, PhotoShop.

Next steps: Plans for a bigger board, adding album art as the uncovered image, and music clips from the record that the image is referencing to play when the curser is hovering over each record for a visually impaired user feature. The music clips are necessary for visually impaired feature.
