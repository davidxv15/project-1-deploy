User is presented with a game board of identical "cards"
facing downwards to conceil their value, which is
shared by only one other card.
User will select one card at a time, revealing it's value
while attempting to memorize said value and it's position
on the board.
User's goal is to select each matching pair of cards in
succession, until all card values have been selected,
thus completing play.
